    <p>I am a Trainee Software Developer with skills in both front- end and back-end applications. My journey in my professional life started out with me in college for digital art. I took many Art classes that made me great at drawing, but I never felt happy about just drawing. I thought will I always loved rocks, so I change majors to geology took some classes and fall in love with the software that geologist use to make charts. Also, at this times I was always working retail. There is so much I learn from databases from working retail and there was always stuff I wish I could change with them. The joy I got from learning SQL and NoSQL from Woz u and seeing how they work was awesome I hope someday to design a user-friendly POS system for a company.</p>
